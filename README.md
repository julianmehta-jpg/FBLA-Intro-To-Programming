FBLA Introduction to Programming 2025-2026
Topic: Virtual Pet Simulator
=======================================================

1. PROGRAM OVERVIEW
This program is a terminal-based Virtual Pet Simulator designed to teach financial responsibility (Cost of Care). Users must balance the health and happiness of their pet with a finite budget, tracking a running total of expenses and striving to reach a savings goal.

2. HOW TO RUN
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed on your system.
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory containing the file.
- Run the command: `python main.py`

3. FEATURES & GAMEPLAY INSTRUCTIONS
- Customization: Choose a name and a pet type (Dog, Cat, Dragon).
- Financial Dashboard: The main screen displays your Current Balance, Lifetime Spend, and a Savings Goal progress tracker.
- Work/Chores (Option 5): To afford care, you must work. Unscramble FBLA-related business terms to earn wages.
- Shop (Option 4): Manage your budget by deciding between Basic Food, Premium Food, or Medicine. 
- Sleep (Option 3): Ends the day. Hunger and Happiness will naturally decay. If hunger drops too low, health will decline.

4. LIBRARIES & TEMPLATES USED
This program uses only the standard built-in Python libraries to ensure maximum compatibility across all judging environments:
- `sys` and `os`: Used for console clearing and I/O flushing.
- `time`: Used for pacing and animations.
- `random`: Used for generating chore challenges.
- `json`: Used for Data Persistence (saving/loading).
- `typing`: Used for strict code structure and readability.

5. CREDITS
- Developed for the FBLA 2025-2026 Competitive Season.
- No external code templates or third-party libraries (e.g., Pygame) were used. All logic, ASCII formatting, and code structures are original.

4. Follow the on-screen prompts by typing the numbers that correspond to your choices!
